# Day 5: Cafeteria

## Part 1

The first part was mostly about getting the parsing right. And then
just checking if the list if IDs is within any of the ranges is pretty
straight forward.

## Part 2

At first, part 2 also seemed to be easy-peasy. Of course, part 2 is always
about curve balls: the big numbers made the problem a bit harder than
it seemed. I had to come up with a way to merge overlapping ranges, and
after that it is easy to find the number of elements within each range.
